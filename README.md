# Solving problems using ADT

ADT (Abstract Data Type) is a data type which provides a logical description of data and the operations that can be performed on them without specifying how those operations are implemented. In C, we can implement ADT using structures and corresponding functions.

 Some common ADTs include:

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Linked List
4. Tree
5. Graph
6. Hash Table
7. Set
8. Map
9. Heap
10. Priority Queue
11. Deque

This repository provides solutions to 14 problems in which you need to use abstract data types. In these problems, we may need abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, and deques. The solution to each problem is in a separate folder. The name of the folder corresponds to the name of the problem.

The list of problems is as follows:

1. Problem A. Brackets
2. Problem B. Sorting of wagons
3. Problem C. Conveyor
4. Problem D. Histogram
5. Problem E. The value of an arithmetic expression
6. Problem F. Logical Expression Value
7. Problem G. Corrupted XML
8. Problem H. Database
9. Problem I. The division of the kingdom
10. Problem J. Depth-first search
11. Problem K. Bureaucracy
12. Problem L. The height of the tree
13. Problem M. Balance
14. Problem N. Transportation

The content of each of the problems is given in the folder corresponding to the problem, in the corresponding README.md file.
